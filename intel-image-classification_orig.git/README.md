# Intel Image Classification Contest _(94%+ ACC)_

This contest was held in 2019 on Kaggle. I will be working on the provided dataset that consists of ~25k natural images with their labels as well as the smaller test set. The purpose of this project is to explore ways in which we can identify images, CNNs and pre-trained models that speed up the process. For the challenge I'm going to use TensorFlow, mainly the Keras part that is build upon it.
